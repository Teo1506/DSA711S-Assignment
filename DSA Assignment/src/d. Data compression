Huffman Encoding will be much more suitable in this case because:
It works well for diverse data types, making it suitable for various applications.
Shorter codes are assigned to more frequent symbols, leading to efficient compression.
Widely used in file compression formats.

The worst-case time complexity is approximately:

O(nlogn) for compression and O(logn) for decompression
